	"t_1_3_2357157"		"Scout: Oh Yeah! That's right! Here we are, Zone C."
	"t_1_4_2357169"		"Heavy: I think nobody lives in this city, except robots."
	"t_1_5_2357219"		"Scout: Everyone! I can hear sound coming from the right way! Someone is fighting!"
	"t_1_6_2357239"		"Soldier: They are fighting! We must help those rebel robots, Let's go!"
	"t_1_7_2358426"		"Robot Soldier: What? Why are humans around here? You are not supposed to be here."
	"t_1_8_2358444"		"Soldier: So, Are you guys rebel robots?"
	"t_1_9_2358454"		"Robot Soldier: Yes, and why are you still here? You should get out of this city now!"
	"t_1_10_2358464"		"Robot Soldier: This city has already captured by Gray's robots."
	"t_1_11_2358476"		"Spy: Why you didn't escape? The Gray's robots are trying to destroy you."
	"t_1_12_2358492"		"Robot Soldier: We tried to escape! But we are on low battery and couldn't escape."
	"t_1_13_2358502"		"Robot Soldier: And they are still trying to find us, so we have no choice unless we fight here."
	"t_1_14_2358512"		"Robot Soldier: Now as you can see, We lost other robots and now only 3 of us are alive."
	"t_1_15_2358535"		"Scout: Uh man... We are too late, If we could come here faster, at least we could save some of your friends."
	"t_1_16_2358555"		"Robot Soldier: Don't blame yourself. We need to prepare to fight them, they are coming to this location now."
	"t_1_17_2358575"		"Heavy: Don't worry! We destroyed over 9000 robots. Let's go!"
	"t_1_18_2358693"		"Soldier: All clear! Robots are destroyed!"
	"t_1_19_2358713"		"Robot Soldier: Thank you, now tell us. Why you decided to help us?"
	"t_1_20_2358731"		"Engineer: We need to find the way to Grey's main base."
	"t_1_21_2358745"		"Robot Soldier: Yes. We can, but it's so difficult to reach there."
	"t_1_22_2358757"		"Robot Soldier: But we have a shortcut to reach there, let me tell you inside our base."
	"t_guide1_2358928"		"You can kill robots on the map to gain EXP and bonus."
	"t_guide2_2358942"		"To start next mission, stand near Soldier Bot for 4 people."
	"t_guide3_2358950"		"To interact something like buttons, items, hit the object with melee."
	"t_mission_start_2358985"		"Mission Started!"
	"t_mission_end_2359001"		"Mission Completed!"
	"t_2_1_2521484"		"Robot Soldier: Those robot are coming from that castle, however there is gas around the castle."
	"t_2_2_2521498"		"Robot Soldier: We need to clear those gas first and I know how to do that."
	"t_2_3_2521508"		"Robot Sniper: Soldier, we got a problem! Battleship is coming towards us!"
	"t_2_4_2521520"		"Robot Soldier: Holy Shit! You need to destroy it quickly before battleship destroy us!"
	"t_3_1_2541000"		"Robot Soldier: So you destroyed battleship? Nice job! Now let's continue our plan."
	"t_3_2_2541010"		"Robot Soldier: But... We are on low battery right now."
	"t_3_3_2541020"		"Robot Soldier: I need you to find fuel gas, batteries and metal scraps."
	"t_3_4_2541030"		"Robot Soldier: Fuel gas can be found at JimiJam Shop, Batteries can be found at Farm"
	"t_3_5_2541042"		"Robot Soldier: And metal scrap can be found at Floor 6, Second room of Mann Co. Hotel."
	"t_3_6_2541063"		"Robot Soldier: Alright, move out! Before we run out of battery!"
	"t_3_7_2541953"		"Robot Soldier: Thank you everyone! Now we can fill our battery right now."
	"t_4_1_2560819"		"Robot Soldier: Alright! Now we are going to talk about the castle's gas."
	"t_4_2_2560833"		"Robot Soldier: The only way to remove castle's gas is.. Drinking the potion."
	"t_4_3_2560853"		"Soldier: What? A potion? Why don't we find the source and destroy it?"
	"t_4_4_2560863"		"Robot Soldier: Do you think after destroying the source, gas will be removed instantly?"
	"t_4_5_2560873"		"Robot Soldier: You're wrong. The gas itself cannot be removed instantly and will take few months for gas to be removed completely."
	"t_4_6_2560887"		"Robot Soldier: So... The only way is to drink the potion. I know how to mix them."
	"t_4_7_2560905"		"Robot Soldier: You need to find a cactus at the farm. A pumpkin is located at small room near our base."
	"t_4_11_2561628"		"Robot Soldier: Finally! Now wait for a moment, I need to mix the potion now. Come back to me later."
	"t_5_1_2580278"		"Robot Soldier: I mixed the potions, Now drink it, And... Did you saw our Scout?"
	"t_5_2_2598960"		"Scout: No... But if you mean human Scout then I'm already here."
	"t_5_3_2598970"		"Robot Sniper: I saw that he has been captured by those robots and locked him into the castle!"
	"t_4_8_2598990"		"Robot Soldier: The mushrooms at the garden beside the beer store."
	"t_4_9_2599012"		"Robot Soldier: And the last ingredient is a yellow potion, But I forgot where it was."
	"t_4_10_2599020"		"Robot Soldier: Perhaps it will be around Town B. Alright let's move!"
	"t_5_4_2599077"		"Robot Soldier: WHAT?! DAMN IT! Hurry, now we need to go the castle quickly!"
	"t_5_5_2618357"		"Robot Scout: Finally! Thanks for coming for me, I thought those robot would find me in here!"
	"t_5_6_2618367"		"Robot Scout: I was captured, but I escaped from robots, and I stealed some infomation from them."
	"t_5_7_2618377"		"Robot Scout: I locked myself here from those robots, And I hid that infomation if those robots could break doors."
	"t_5_8_2618395"		"Robot Scout: Sorry, But I'm going to die soon.... I can't get that infomation for you, I hope you can find it."
	"t_5_9_2618415"		"Robot Scout: It's below somewhere of these crates, And... *Shutting down*"
	"t_5_10_2618445"		"Engineer: Sorry about that we couldn't help you. Now let's find that infomation!"
	"t_5_11_2618574"		"Robot Soldier: Uh... Damn it.. We lost scout, But it's good that we have this infomation, I need more time to read this."
	"t_6_1_2637221"		"Robot Soldier: I read that infomation. It's about how to open the gate to zone B."
	"t_6_2_2637231"		"Robot Soldier: If you want to go Gray's base then the only way is to zone B"
	"t_6_3_2637241"		"Robot Soldier: But only robots can open the gate by using their language, So it's impossible to open door without us."
	"t_6_4_2637251"		"Robot Soldier: We will meet you there, Let's go to the gate B."
	"t_6_5_2637462"		"Robot Soldier: Alright everyone, Let see what happen, I'm gonna speak robot language now!"
	"t_6_6_2637476"		"Robot Soldier: 01110000010101001010010101010101010101011111000101"
	"t_6_7_2637591"		"Robot Soldier: Hmm this is a controller of this gate, I need to connect this to open it."
	"t_6_8_2637601"		"Robot Soldier: It will take for 5 minutes, Sniper and I need to be covered."
	"t_6_9_2637615"		"Robot Soldier: Don't let any robots attack us while we connecting the gate!"
