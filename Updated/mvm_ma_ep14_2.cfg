	"t_4_3_2560853"		"Soldier : What? A potion? Why don't we find the source of the gas and destroy it?"
	"t_4_4_2560863"		"Robot Soldier : Do you think if you destroyed the source and the gas will be removed instantly?"
	"t_4_5_2560873"		"Robot Soldier : No... the gas won't be removed instantly and should take few months until the gas removed completely."
	"t_4_6_2560887"		"Robot Soldier : So... The only way is to drink the potion, I know how to mix them."
	"t_4_7_2560905"		"Robot Soldier : You need to find a cactus at the farm, A pumpkin in box at mini-room near our base."
	"t_4_11_2561628"		"Robot Soldier : Finally! Now wait for a moment, I need to mix the potion now. Come back to me later."

	"t_5_4_2599077"		"Robot Soldier : WHAT?! DAMNIT! Now we need to go the castle quickly, GO GO GO!"
	"t_5_5_2618357"		"Robot Scout : Finally! You have come, I thought those robot would break in here!"
	"t_5_6_2618367"		"Robot Scout : I was captured, but I escaped from these robots, and I stole some infomation from these robots."
	"t_5_7_2618377"		"Robot Scout : I locked myself here from those robots, And I hide that infomation if those robots can broke in"
